Welcome to my portfolio!
=================

I created this portfolio website following along with this tutorial [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xkSvufmjEs&list=PLttH_g5uIl1-uXbnKg3QqzqkqlhYFAOe8&index=2&t=4956s) from free code camp.

I've personalized it and added things of my own but I could not have done it without that video. It was really interesting to
see how to **properly** use css with html.

I used glitch while creating the website because I really liked the platform while I used it in the Oakhacks 2020 hackathon.

I learned a lot about web development while making this portfolio, and I had a lot of fun too!
